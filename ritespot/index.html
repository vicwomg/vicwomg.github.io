        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The Rite Spot is a beloved local spot for dinner, drinks and live
          music. We are a family owned, woman operated, small business. Thriving
          in the Mission for almost 70 years, Rite Spot is an ideal stop for an
          evening of what San Francisco once was and still is, a city of music
          and art. We offer free live entertainment every night when we are
          open, paired with comfort food and strong drinks. We appreciate
          everyone who has continued to support us through the years and these
          difficult times! We would not be here without the support from our
          Rite Spot family of musicians/performers, music aficionados, patrons
          and staff. We look forward to sharing this community in the years to
          come with both long time loves and new faces.
        </p>
