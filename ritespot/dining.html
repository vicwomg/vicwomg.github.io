          Whether you're at the Rite Spot Cafe for a full evening of cocktails,
          dining and live music or just a quick drink on the way home, The Rite
          Spot Cafe is a local favorite. The Rite Spot is located within walking
          distance of the Oberlin Dance Collective, Theater Artaud, Noh Space, A
          Traveling Jewish Theater, Mission Bowling Club and not far from the
          heart of the Mission District filled with bars, nightclubs and
          restaurants. We are a short walk, drive or cab ride on your way out to
          see live music at Brick and Mortar, The Elbo Room, Hemlock Tavern and
          The Bottom of the Hill making The Rite Spot Cafe an ideal stop for
          dinner and drinks before a night on the town. Very easy street parking
          after 7:00 pm most nights.

          The Rite Spot Cafe boasts the best Irish coffee in town despite what
          anyone else has to say on the subject as well as an only small and
          obscure vineyard wine list. We like to support the little guy being
          one ourselves! Top shelf single malt Scotch, Bourbon, Rye plus an
          extensive Tequila list. Our beer list is local heavy but filled with
          domestic and imported options plus a few ciders round out our well
          stocked bar.
